# Kory's website!

This is my website. I like it. Here are some things that are cool about it:

- ~~Shamelessly~~ Shamefully stolen design from [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/)
  - My theft was shameless until I read on Andy Bell's blog: "fellas (itâ€™s always the fellas) love to rip off other peoples websites, which is absolutely not cool." Whoops.
- A custom webhook route at [https://korysmith.dev/webhooks/peat](https://github.com/kory-smith/korysmith.dev/blob/main/functions/webhooks/peat.ts) that creates a Notion project for notes whenever I create a Todoist project so I can take notes. It also creates a link in the project!
- Staging set up to track the `stage` branch at https://stage.korysmith.dev/
- Manual font subsetting with [glyphhanger](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger) (I'll make it automatic with [subfont](https://github.com/Ernxst/subfont) when I get that to work)
