# Kory's website!

This is my website. I like it. Here are some things that are cool about it:

- Shamelessly stolen design from [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/)
- A custom webhook route at [https://korysmith.dev/webhooks/peat](https://github.com/kory-smith/korysmith.dev/blob/main/functions/webhooks/peat.ts) that creates a Notion project for notes whenever I create a Todoist project so I can take notes. It also creates a link in the project!
- Staging set up to track the `stage` branch at https://stage.korysmith.dev/
- Automatic font subsetting with [subfont](https://github.com/Ernxst/subfont), which makes my webfont files really, really small.
