## Software

### [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) and [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Together, these make up my [keyboard](https://github.com/kory-smith/keyboard) repository, which gives me keyboard superpowers.

Notable features:

- `caps lock` pressed alone is escape.
- `caps lock` pressed with another key turns caps lock into a `hyper` key, which is a custom modifier.
- `caps lock` pressed with `shift` pressed with another key does various utilities
  - `shift` + `hyper` + `N`, for example, takes the currently focused window and moves it to the next monitor
- `s` + `d` takes me into “super duper mode”
  - `i` and `o` let me go in and out of tabs
  - `u` and `p` take me to the first or last tab
  - `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` behave as they do in Vim, so `s` + `d` + `h` takes me forward a character. Super handy
  - `space` acts as shift, so `s` + `d` + `space` + `h` selects the character to the left of the cursor

### [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

Simply the best to-do list application that exists. Nothing else comes close.

Todoist has three superpowers:

1. A powerful language parser. Give it a task “Call mom at the end of every month starting next month” and it’ll do exactly what you hope it would do.
2. Powerful label and filter systems. You can easily create filters such as “Show me only tasks that are overdue across all my work projects.”
3. [Todoist-shortcuts](https://github.com/mgsloan/todoist-shortcuts). Lets you use Todoist like Vim.

### [Todoist Shortcuts](https://github.com/mgsloan/todoist-shortcuts)

Adds Vim shortcuts to Todoist.

### [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

Another MacOS automation tool. I’d previously used Alfred, and the thing that made me switch was that Raycast uses React and TypeScript to power its extensions, which are languages I’m more familiar with.

Here are the things I use it for:

- [Clipboard history](https://www.raycast.com/extensions/clipboard-history)
- ~~Snippet expansion~~
  - I recently replaced this with [Espanso](https://espanso.org/)
- [Kill process](https://www.raycast.com/rolandleth/kill-process)
- [Finder to iTerm (and iTerm to Finder)](https://www.raycast.com/yedongze/terminalfinder)
- [Caffeinate command (called Coffee)](https://www.raycast.com/mooxl/coffee)
- [Window resizer/mover](https://www.raycast.com/extensions/window-management)
- [Open recent VSCode projects](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/visual-studio-code)
- [Pinboard](https://www.raycast.com/fe9lix/pinboard) (I made modifications to this one, and they’re not in the extensions store)

### [Espanso](https://espanso.org/)

Open source, multi-platform text expansion that _always_ works. Imagine that.

### [SurfingKeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys)

Vim keybindings for Chrome and Chrome-based browsers. Completely changed the way I use the internet.

### [Git-Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

A git GUI with a name that makes it nearly impossible to Google about. Still, it’s excellent for more complicated git workflows, like dropping several commits from a branch. Plus, it’s beautiful.

### [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/)

Pinboard is the minimum-viable product bookmark manager. You save a URL. You give it a title. You give it a description. And you give it tags. It looks like it was built in 2001. And it’s perfect.
