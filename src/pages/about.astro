  <h1>About Kory</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Kory Smith! I'm a web developer based out of Cincinnati, Ohio
    (previously Brooklyn, New York). I'm currently working on the DevOps team at
    Kroger. I'm especially interested in web performance, web standards, and
    fonts.

  <p>Here's a picture of me, so you know what I look like:</p>
