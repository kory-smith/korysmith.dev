  <h1>About Kory</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Kory Smith! I'm a software developer living in Cincinnati, Ohio
    (previously Brooklyn, New York). I'm currently working as a support engineer
    at <a href="https://usetrmnl.com/">TRMNL</a>. It's awesome.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm also the owner of <a href="https://spook.software/">Spook Software</a>,
    where I make software feels nice to use.

  <p>Here's a picture of me, so you know what I look like:</p>
